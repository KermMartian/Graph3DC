=========================================

Graph3DC for the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition lets you
graph 3D functions on your graphing calculator, a
function missing from TI's own TI-OS. It integrates with
the TI-OS so you can either graph 3D equations or continue
to use the built-in 2D graphing tools. You can graph
between 1 and 5 functions simultaneously, control the
appearance of graphs including color, background color,
axes, set the window, zoom in and out, and more. Because
Graph3DC integrates fully with the TI-OS, you can even
set your calculator into Horizontal splitscreen mode and
view 3D plots and the homescreen simultaneously.
